        <p>
            THIS Amazing Blueberry Muffin has been my weekness! the perfect flavor and textures just make a morning (or
            in my case afternoon) cup of coffee that much more savory!

            there are a lot of things I enjoy but I have to say, some quiet + quality time spent visiting over a cup of
            coffee and some sweet goodies has got to be one of my top favorites!
